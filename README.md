# Car-Price-Prediction

A Python Notebook that provides an in-depth walkthrough of data collection, processing, visualization, and analysis of a large used car dataset. We analyze the effects of several attributes on the price of used cars as well as train a machine learning model to predict the price of a used car based on the value of those attributes. 

This is part of an open-ended final group project for a fall 2021 semester CMSC320 class at UMD.
